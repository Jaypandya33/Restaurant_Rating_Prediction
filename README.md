# Restaurant Rating Prediction Project

# Overview
## The Restaurant Rating Prediction Project is a machine learning-based application that predicts the ratings of restaurants based on various features. Leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, this project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing restaurant ratings, ultimately assisting users in making informed decisions about where to dine.

# Key Features
# Data Exploration: Gain insights into the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and potential trends.
# Predictive Modeling: Utilize machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model capable of estimating restaurant ratings based on input features.
# User-Friendly Interface: Interact with the model through an intuitive user interface that allows users to input restaurant features and receive a predicted rating.

## Workflows

1. upload csv dataset file in notebooks section.
2. Perform EDA, FE and model training.
3. update utils, exception and logger file in src folder.
4. update components in src folder-->mlProject. 
5. update the pipeline
6. update the app.py
7. update templates and static folder for web API.

# How to run?
### STEPS:

# Let's first initialize git.

# Here we are using bash terminal
```
git init
```

```
git add abc.txt
git add.
```

```
git commit -m "this is my first commit"
```

```
git pull
```

```
bash init_setup.sh
```

```
python setup.py install
```

#another way: you can mention -e in requirements.txt and run corresponding command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#To import flask in your current environment

```
pip install Flask
```

```
python app.py
```

```
Now open up your local host 0.0.0.0:8080
```
